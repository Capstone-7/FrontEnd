## WHAT DO WE DO?
In this Capstone project, we were given a study case regarding Payment Point Online Banking (PPOB), which is a payment billing mechanism that works with banks that are connected online in real time so that data reconciliation occurs very quickly with very accurate data accuracy.

We call this project Payoll. The products we offer are bill payers, such as phone credit, data packages, electronic money, and PLN electricity.
